# files2folders
Use this bash script to turn all files that match a file type into a folder with that file inside of it

This was made on Ubuntu 18.04.2LTS but it should work on anything that can execute a bash script. I made this because I needed to put a couple hundred of movies into their own folders and that was going to be too tedious to do so I spend an hour or so making this. Thought some people also might find this useful
