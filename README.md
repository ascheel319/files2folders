# files2folders
Use this bash script to turn all files that match a file type into a folder with that file inside of it

This was made on Ubuntu 18.04.2LTS but it should work on anything that can execute a bash script. I made this because I needed to put a couple hundred of movies into their own folders and that was going to be too tedious to do so I spend an hour or so making this. Thought some people also might find this useful. This script will also grab any files with the same name, like any subtitle files or anything with the same name until the extension.

Steps:
1. Execute the file
2. Put in the directory that you want it to work with
3. Input the file type you want to look for
4. That's it.
